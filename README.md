## what features does this contain  
This version of the game focuses alot on the graphics, with images for all the implemented space types and an easy way to make new maps.  
Furthermore, checkpoints is fully implemented and when a player lands on all checkpoints in the numerical order, that player wins the game.  
Walls is implemented so you can't go through them and you can push players (not through walls).
